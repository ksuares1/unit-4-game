## Getting Started
- Players have to guess the number of the crystal and try to match it. This action is achieved using JavaScript and jQuery. 
- Four crystals are displayed as buttons on the page. 
- First players are shown a random number at the beginning of the game. 
- When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
  Initally this amount is hidden until the player clicks a crystal.
  When a player clicks one, the player's score counter is updated.
- The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
- The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
- The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
